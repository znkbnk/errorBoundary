In this project, you will learn how to
implement error boundaries in a React
application. Error boundaries are components
in React that catch JavaScript errors in
their child component tree, log those errors,
and display a fallback UI instead of crashing
the entire application. By using error
boundaries, you can prevent your React 
application from breaking due to unexpected
errors and provide a better user experience.
As a result, it is not common for programmers
to create their own ErroBoundary components
in the first place. Instead they will often
turn to implementations such as
'www.github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary'
package.

Step 1: Set up a React project

- Create a new React project using your preferred
method (e.g., create-react-app or manual setup).
- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies
installed.

Step 2: Identify a component tree for error
boundary implementation

- Identify a component tree or a specific
component that you want to wrap with an 
error boundary. This component tree should
represent a critical part of your application
where errors might occur.

Step 3: Create an ErrorBoundary component

- Create a new file called ErrorBoundary.js.
- Define a class component named ErrorBoundary
that extends React.Component.
- Implement the componentDidCatch lifecycle
method within the ErrorBoundary class.
- Inside the componentDidCatch method, handle
the error by logging it or performing
any necessary actions.

Step 4: Wrap the component tree with the
ErrorBoundary component

- Open the file that contains the component
tree you identified in Step 2.
- Import the ErrorBoundary component
into this file.
- Wrap the component tree with the
ErrorBoundary component by placing it as
a parent of the component tree.

Step 5: Define a fallback UI

- Within the ErrorBoundary component,
define a fallback UI to be displayed
when an error occurs.
- This fallback UI can be a custom 
component or a predefined component,
depending on your application's design.

Step 6: Test the error boundary

- Introduce an intentional error within
the component tree you wrapped with
the ErrorBoundary.
- Ensure that the error is caught by the
ErrorBoundary and that the
fallback UI is displayed.
- Test various scenarios to make sure
the error boundary works as expected.

Step 7: Repeat the process if needed

- If you have multiple critical parts of
your application, repeat Steps 2-6 to
implement error boundaries for each of them.
- Consider whether you need a different
fallback UI for different parts of
your application.

Step 8: Refine and improve error handling

- Review the error logs and improve error
handling in your application.
- Consider providing more informative error
messages or logging the errors to a
server for analysis.

Step 9: Document your error boundary
implementation

- Document the usage of error boundaries
in your project's documentation
or Readme file.
- Explain the purpose and benefits of error
boundaries to other developers working
on the project.
